# PDF Merger & Splitter - Python + Tkinter 📄⚡

✨ **Day 10 of our 30-Day Coding Challenge** with Swara Gharat  

Today we built a **PDF Merger & Splitter App** — a Python desktop tool that lets users merge multiple PDFs into a single file or split a PDF into separate pages. This project combines **Python scripting** with **GUI development** to create a practical and user-friendly tool.
